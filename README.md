â˜• Coffee Orders Data Analysis Project

This data analysis project investigates customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance from a fictional coffee company.
Using Microsoft Excel,we performed deep insights into purchasing patterns, product profitability, and customer loyalty by analyzing a dataset with over 1,000 coffee orders.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The dataset consists of four main components:

Orders: 1,000+ transactional records containing product type, quantity, sales, roast type, and customer loyalty info.

Customers: Detailed customer information including location, contact, and loyalty card status.

Products: Coffee product metadata like coffee type, roast, size, and profit margins.

TotalSales Summary: A pivot-style summary of monthly and yearly sales by coffee type.

This project is entirely built in Excel using pivot tables, charts, data validation, and dashboards to extract insights and visualize key metrics.
